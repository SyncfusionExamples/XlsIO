# 5 Easy Ways to Protect Excel Data in C#

Syncfusion&reg; Excel Library (XlsIO) provides various options to easily protect and unprotect Excel documents in C# and VB.NET, and this repository contains practical projects to demonstrate those capabilities. Excel protection is a key feature in many business applications where sensitive data, formulas, or layout structures need to be secured from accidental edits or unauthorized changes. Using XlsIO, developers can apply password protection to entire workbooks, individual worksheets, or specific ranges, ensuring that only permitted users can modify content. The library also supports locking cells, hiding formulas, restricting formatting changes, and controlling access to structural elements like rows and columns. These features can be implemented programmatically without relying on Microsoft Excel Interop, making the solution lightweight and suitable for server-side automation or cloud deployments. The examples in this repository show how to enable protection with custom settings, remove protection when needed, and manage security across Excel file. Whether you're building reporting tools, financial models, or data entry templates, these samples offer a reliable way to enforce document integrity and user permissions using Syncfusion's high-performance Excel APIs.
